# Fantasy Football Draft App (By Lespy)

## Summary

This application is designed to assist fantasy football leagues that prefer offline drafts by providing an efficient way to display a live draft board and give each team visibility to their team's roster as the draft occurs.

## Application Concept and Wireframe

### Application Concept

- Landing Page

  - Allows draft manager to login for an existing league, or create a new account for the league. (Only league managers will need an account. Individual team pages will be accessible without logins as these are just read-only pages.)

- Draft Manager Page

  - This page is where the league manager can conduct the draft by drafting players to teams, handle trades, add keepers and finalize the draft (send results in email)

- Team Page

  - View point for each team to see their roster compiled live.

- Draft Board
  - This view is intended to be opened on an additional tab that can be casted to a television or accessed by a person's tablet/PC for a convenient view.
